Honestly, do whatever you want, just uh, dont sell it.
Anyway, heres a modding... tutorial?

Basically, dont fuck with the launcher files
Feel free to do whatever you want to the game files though (good fun to be had)

			MODDING
-----------------------------------
BASIC TYPES:
Most of the publicly used types are located in "mortem/common/cm_public.h"

mBoolean - assigned a value of mTrue or mFalse, a boolean redef
string_t - a string type for names and file locations
byte - an interger with a really small max value (255)
word - same as byte but with a larger max value (65,535)

MATH TYPES:
vec_t - a redefine of floats used for vectors
vec2/3/4_t - a variable holding 2/3/4 values, used for coordinates and (maybe)
			 parameters

ENTITIES:
To create an entity, create a class with a header and cpp file. The class 
should inherit the CBaseEntity class in game/cbase.h. Depending on the type of 
entity, make sure to override the nesecarry functions to make the entity
function properly. e.g void Spawn() override;
