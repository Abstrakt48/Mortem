LOCATION:
You live in a post-soviet russia esque location (brutalist architecture, 
snow everywhere).

Set in 1993 (after 1991, the end of the soviet union)

you wake up at night and no one is around. all house lights are off, street 
lights flickering, litter everywhere. (good to set the scene as some creepy 
place, story building can be alot more fun from here on out)
