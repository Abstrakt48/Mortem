LOCATION:
You live in a post-soviet russia esque location (brutalist architecture, 
snow everywhere).

You are some dude that was driving home but the car infront of you swerves 
and causes you to swerve to. your car flips and you get knocked out. when you 
wake up its night and no one is around. all house lights are off, street lights
flickering, litter everywhere. (good to set the scene as some creepy place,
story building can be alot more fun from here on out)
